# Learning sandbox

This is a learning project aimed at familiarizing myself with a new technology stack that includes Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. 

## Brief introduction to these tecnologies:

- ### Java:
    Java is a popular, general-purpose programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is known for its "write once, run anywhere" principle, meaning that Java code can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise software.

- ### Spring Boot:
    Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework, which simplifies the development of Java applications. It provides a set of tools and conventions that make it easier to create standalone, production-ready Spring applications with minimal configuration. Spring Boot promotes convention over configuration and offers a wide range of features for building web applications, microservices, and RESTful APIs. It also includes embedded servers, dependency management, and auto-configuration capabilities.

- ### PostgreSQL:
    PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for its robustness, scalability, and compliance with SQL standards. PostgreSQL supports a wide range of advanced features, including transactions, ACID properties, data integrity, and extensibility. It is commonly used as a backend database for web applications, enterprise systems, and data-intensive projects. PostgreSQL is known for its reliability and is often favored for its ability to handle complex data models and high-volume workloads.

### Conclusion
   In combination, Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL provide a powerful stack for building scalable and reliable applications. Java serves as the programming language, Spring Boot provides a streamlined development framework, and PostgreSQL offers a robust and feature-rich database solution. Together, they enable developers to create efficient, maintainable, and scalable applications for various use cases.
